# Project: Members-Only

In this project, we're building an exclusive clubhouse where members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

This project is about Authentication and it's part of The Odin Project - Ruby on Rails course. More information at: http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/authentication.
